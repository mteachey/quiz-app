     answerThree : 'cow',
     answerFour : 'dharma',
     correctAnswer : 2,
     correctAnswerCopy : 'Asana is the Sanskirt word for pose or literally, seat. This meaning is reflected in the fact that the Sanskrit words for individual yoga poses always include the suffix \"asana\" - for example, the Sanskrit word for the Lotus pose is Padmasana. Because asana means \"seat\" in Sanskrit, experts believe that the first yoga asanas were simple seated positions that were held for long periods of time in order to facilitate meditation.',

Sometime around the fourth to sixth centuries CE, the insight took hold that if there is only Spirit, then all of creation, including the human body, is a manifestation of Spirit and therefore sacred. They viewed the body as a dwelling place of the Divine and as the cauldron for accomplishing spiritual perfection. The stage was set for Hatha Yoga. A system that includes the practice of asanas (yoga postures) and pranayama (breathing exercises), which help bring peace to the mind and body, preparing the body for deeper spiritual practices such as meditation.',
